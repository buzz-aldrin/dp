3.  The Longest Increasing Subsequence - https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/longest-increasing-subsequence-dp-3/
    (LIS) problem is to find the length of the longest subsequence of a given sequence such that all elements of the
    subsequence are sorted in increasing order. For example, the length of LIS
    for  and LIS is .

    Examples:
        {10, 22, 9, 33, 21, 50, 41, 60, 80} LIS is 6 i.e {10, 22, 33, 50, 60, 80}
    Explanation:
         10	22	29	24	25	50	41	60	80
    LIS  1	2	3	3	4	5	5	6	7
                        LIS(4)
                /			|		\
            LIS(3)		LIS(2)		LIS(1)
            /	\			|
        LIS(2)	LIS(1)	LIS(1)
        /
    LIS(1)


4.  Longest Common Subsequence - https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/longest-common-subsequence-dp-4/
    It is a classic computer science problem, the basis of diff (a file comparison program that outputs the differences
    between two files), and has applications in bio-informatics.

    Examples:
    LCS for input Sequences “ABCDGH” and “AEDFHR” is “ADH” of length 3.
    LCS for input Sequences “AGGTAB” and “GXTXAYB” is “GTAB” of length 4.

                            lcs("AXYT", "AYZX")
                           /                 \
             lcs("AXY", "AYZX")            lcs("AXYT", "AYZ")
             /                \              /               \
    lcs("AX", "AYZX") lcs("AXY", "AYZ")   lcs("AXY", "AYZ") lcs("AXYT", "AY")

5.  Edit Distance - https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/edit-distance-dp-5/
    Given two strings str1 and str2 and below operations that can performed on str1. Find minimum number of edits
    (operations) required to convert ‘str1’ into ‘str2’.
    a. Insert
    b. Remove
    c. Replace
    All of the above operations are of equal cost.
    Examples:
        Input:   str1 = "geek", str2 = "gesek"
        Output:  1
        We can convert str1 into str2 by inserting a 's'.

        Input:   str1 = "cat", str2 = "cut"
        Output:  1
        We can convert str1 into str2 by replacing 'a' with 'u'.
