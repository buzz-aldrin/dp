3.  The Longest Increasing Subsequence - https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/longest-increasing-subsequence-dp-3/
    (LIS) problem is to find the length of the longest subsequence of a given sequence such that all elements of the
    subsequence are sorted in increasing order. For example, the length of LIS
    for  and LIS is .

    Examples:
        {10, 22, 9, 33, 21, 50, 41, 60, 80} LIS is 6 i.e {10, 22, 33, 50, 60, 80}
    Explanation:
         10	22	29	24	25	50	41	60	80
    LIS  1	2	3	3	4	5	5	6	7
                        LIS(4)
                /			|		\
            LIS(3)		LIS(2)		LIS(1)
            /	\			|
        LIS(2)	LIS(1)	LIS(1)
        /
    LIS(1)


4.  Longest Common Subsequence - https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/longest-common-subsequence-dp-4/
    It is a classic computer science problem, the basis of diff (a file comparison program that outputs the differences
    between two files), and has applications in bio-informatics.

    Examples:
    LCS for input Sequences “ABCDGH” and “AEDFHR” is “ADH” of length 3.
    LCS for input Sequences “AGGTAB” and “GXTXAYB” is “GTAB” of length 4.
